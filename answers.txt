- What happens if users choose “Cancel”?

Since the "If...else" algorithm only checks if the user has either pressed "Yes" or not, that means pressing "Cancel" will have the same effect as pressing "No".


- How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t” (Suggestion: Use Javadocs or using Eclipse/Netbean IDE help).  

Change to using OptionDialog instead of ConfirmDialog, then customize the buttons from there.
